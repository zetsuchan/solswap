# SolSwap: Advanced LST Aggregator and Stableswap Protocol

SolSwap is a sophisticated protocol designed to revolutionize the management and trading of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) on the Solana blockchain. By combining advanced risk management, dynamic curve optimization, and comprehensive validator tracking, SolSwap provides a secure and efficient platform for LST trading and liquidity provision.

## Core Features

### Risk-Adjusted Curve Optimization

SolSwap employs an innovative approach to curve mathematics by incorporating real-time risk metrics into swap calculations. Our dynamic curve adjustment system considers:

- Validator performance metrics and historical data
- Current reserve ratios and utilization rates
- Decentralization scores across the validator network
- MEV reward distribution patterns

This sophisticated approach ensures that swap prices accurately reflect underlying risks and market conditions, providing better price discovery and protection for traders and liquidity providers.

### Advanced Oracle Integration

Our protocol utilizes a state-of-the-art oracle system that combines multiple price feeds for maximum accuracy and reliability:

- Weighted median price calculation from multiple trusted sources
- 150-second Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for price smoothing
- Integration with both Pyth and Switchboard for robust price discovery
- Dynamic oracle weight adjustment based on performance metrics

### Comprehensive Liquidity Protection

SolSwap implements multiple layers of liquidity protection to ensure protocol stability and user safety:

- Dynamic fee adjustment based on utilization rates and risk levels
- Sophisticated insurance fund management with automatic rebalancing
- Risk-based allocation strategies for optimal capital efficiency
- Automated parameter updates based on market conditions

### Validator Network Integration

As an LST-focused protocol, SolSwap maintains comprehensive validator tracking and analysis:

- 30-day rolling performance history for all validators
- MEV reward tracking and distribution monitoring
- Stake-weighted performance metrics
- Real-time risk score calculations affecting pool parameters

## Technical Architecture

SolSwap is built on Solana using the Anchor framework, featuring:

- Advanced curve mathematics with risk adjustment
- Comprehensive state management
- Robust error handling and safety checks
- Efficient account structure design
