# SolSwap: Advanced LST Aggregator and StableSwap Protocol

SolSwap is a sophisticated protocol designed to revolutionize the management and trading of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) on the Solana blockchain, with advanced integration of JitoSOL and mSOL.

## Core Features

### Risk-Adjusted LST Baskets
- Dynamic weighting based on comprehensive risk factors
- MEV-enhanced yield tracking for JitoSOL
- Directed stake optimization for mSOL
- Multi-factor risk scoring system
- Automated rebalancing with MEV considerations

### Advanced LST Integration
#### JitoSOL Features
- MEV rewards distribution system
- Enhanced yield tracking
- Auto-compounding mechanisms
- MEV-boost network integration

#### mSOL Features
- Directed stake implementation
- Validator diversity optimization
- Enhanced decentralization metrics
- Cross-protocol yield strategies

### Optimized StableSwap AMM
- Custom curve optimization for LST characteristics
- MEV-aware pricing mechanisms
- Dynamic fee adjustment based on pool balance
- Concentrated liquidity for enhanced capital efficiency

### Validator Tracking System
- Real-time performance metrics
- MEV reward tracking
- Directed stake performance monitoring
- Risk score calculations
- Reserve verification systems

## Technical Architecture

Built on Solana using the Anchor framework, with specialized components for:
- MEV reward distribution
- Directed stake management
- Cross-protocol yield optimization
- Risk-adjusted pool management

## Getting Started
