# SolSwap: Advanced LST Aggregator and StableSwap Protocol

SolSwap is a sophisticated protocol designed to revolutionize the management and trading of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) on the Solana blockchain. By combining risk-adjusted token baskets, efficient swap mechanisms, and comprehensive validator tracking, SolSwap provides an innovative solution for LST liquidity and yield optimization.

## Core Features

Our protocol introduces several groundbreaking features to enhance the LST ecosystem:

### Risk-Adjusted LST Baskets
We implement dynamic weighting of LST tokens based on multiple risk factors:
- Validator performance metrics and historical reliability
- Protocol security assessments
- Decentralization measurements
- Yield stability tracking
- Automated rebalancing mechanisms

### Optimized StableSwap AMM
Our specialized automated market maker is designed specifically for LST pairs:
- Custom curve optimization for LST characteristics
- Dynamic fee adjustment based on pool balance
- Concentrated liquidity for enhanced capital efficiency
- Minimal slippage protection mechanisms

### Validator Tracking System
We maintain comprehensive monitoring of validator performance:
- Real-time performance metrics
- Continuous uptime tracking
- Risk score calculations
- Reserve verification systems

## Technical Architecture

SolSwap is built on Solana using the Anchor framework, emphasizing security, efficiency, and scalability.
